This is a exmple of a TensorFlow Nural network.

The objective is to help determine the likelyhood that a patient, with provided medical inforamtion, will be diagnosed with a heart condition. 

By using Pyhtons Kira and Pandas Libraries I created a Classification Nural Network which is able to predict the likelyhood of developing a heart condition. 

There is not a need to download the source code, for I have included the results of the experiment with the code.
